            <h2>Steps</h2>
            <section class="recipe-steps">
                <ol class="feature">
                    <li>Gather the ingredients. </li>
                    <li>Place the dried fruit, candied peel, apple, and orange and lemon zests and juices into a large
                        mixing
                        bowl.
                        Add the brandy and stir well. Cover the bowl with a clean tea towel and leave to marinate for a
                        couple
                        of
                        hours, preferably overnight.</li>
                    <li>Lightly butter a 2 1/2 pint pudding basin.</li>
                    <li>In a very large mixing bowl, stir the flour, mixed spice, and cinnamon together. Add the suet,
                        sugar,
                        breadcrumbs, and almonds, and stir again until all the ingredients are well mixed. Add the
                        marinated
                        dried
                        fruits and stir again.</li>
                    <li>In a small bowl, beat the eggs lightly, then stir quickly into the dry ingredients. The mixture
                        should
                        have
                        a fairly soft consistency.</li>
                    <li>Spoon the mixture into the greased pudding basin, gently pressing the mixture down with the back
                        of
                        a
                        spoon.
                        Cover with a double layer of greaseproof paper or baking parchment, then a layer of aluminum
                        foil.
                        Tie
                        securely with string, wrapping the string around the basin, then loop over the top and then
                        around
                        the
                        bowl
                        again. This will form a handle, which will be useful when removing the pudding from the steamer.
                    </li>
                    <li>Set a steamer over a saucepan of simmering water, place the pudding in the steamer, and steam
                        the
                        pudding
                        for 7 hours. Make sure you check the water level frequently, so it never boils dry. The pudding
                        should
                        be a
                        dark brown color when cooked.</li>
                    <li>Remove the pudding from the steamer and cool completely. Remove the paper, prick the pudding
                        with a
                        skewer
                        in a few places, and pour in a little extra brandy.</li>
                    <li>Cover with fresh greaseproof paper and retie with string.</li>
                    <li>Store for at least 4 to 5 weeks in a cool, dry place until Christmas Day. On Christmas Day,
                        reheat
                        the
                        pudding by steaming again for about an hour. Enjoy!</li>
